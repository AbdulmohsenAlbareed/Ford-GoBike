# Ford-GoBike
The Ford GoBike system dataset provides anonymized, timestamped data about the start- and end- station for a bike, the user type (subscriber or casual rider), as well as some customer-reported attributes like birth year and gender. If youâ€™re already familiar with the CitiBike NYC or RideIndego datasets, the Ford GoBike dataset is similarly structured.Our goal from this project:
1.Provide an overview of the key insights from the analysis of the rider dataset.

2.Highlight the main threads of analysis and their significance.

3.Present visualizations and data summaries to support the findings.

4.Discuss the implications of the insights and their potential applications.

5.Facilitate a clear understanding of the rider characteristics, their impact on trip duration and distance, and the

6.relationship between weekdays and ride patterns.
