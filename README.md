# (Ford GoBike Exploration )
## by Abdulmohsen ali albareed


## Dataset

> The Ford GoBike system dataset provides anonymized, timestamped data about the start- and end- station for a bike, the user type (subscriber or casual rider), as well as some customer-reported attributes like birth year and gender. If youâ€™re already familiar with the CitiBike NYC or RideIndego datasets, the Ford GoBike dataset is similarly structured.


## Summary of Findings

> Thursday is the most popular day for riders to make a trip. The majority of riders are male, outnumbering females by 70%. One limitation of the dataset is that it only includes data from February. The distribution of trip durations ranges from 1 to 60 minutes, with a right-skewed distribution. Similarly, the distribution of trip distances ranges from 100 meters to 8 kilometers, also skewed to the right. The birth dates of riders span from the 1940s to the 2000s, with a left-skewed distribution. Riders heading to Parker Ave at McAllister St, Mendell St at Fairfax Ave, or Williams Ave at Apollo St will travel approximately 4 kilometers. However, those starting their ride from Williams Ave at Apollo St will need to travel more than 5 kilometers to reach their destination. The days with the fewest rides by subscribers are Sunday and Saturday, with male subscribers being the most common gender. Comparing trip duration and distance with variables such as birth year, gender, and weekdays, it was found that riders born between the 1960s and 1980s performed better in terms of duration and distance compared to those born in the 2000s. Female riders took an average of 12.48 minutes to complete 1.7 kilometers, while male riders took 10.7 minutes to complete 1.6 kilometers. Finally, riders tend to take more time on their trips during Saturdays and Sundays.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Main Threads:

>1.Analysis of Rider Characteristics: This thread focuses on the characteristics of the riders, such as gender distribution, birth dates, and their impact on trip duration and distance. It also highlights the differences between riders born in different decades and how it affects their performance in terms of duration and distance.

>2.Day of the Week Analysis: This thread explores the relationship between the day of the week and the number of rides, as well as the impact on trip duration. It identifies Thursday as the most popular day for riders and discusses the differences in ride patterns between weekdays and weekends.

>Design Changes:
During the exploration phase, several key insights were identified. To polish up these threads for the presentation, we can incorporate visualizations such as graphs and charts to effectively communicate the findings. Additionally, we can provide more context and explanations for the observed patterns and their potential implications. This will enhance the clarity and understanding of the audience.
